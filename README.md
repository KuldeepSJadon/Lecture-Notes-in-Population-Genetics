Lecture-Notes-in-Population-Genetics
====================================

The files here provide the <tt>LaTeX</tt> and other files I use for producing the lecture notes I use in EEB 5348 at the University of Connecticut: http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/eeb348/lecture-notes/notes.html. The <tt>LaTeX</tt> source files are licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). Some of the graphical artwork will also be available under the same license (when I have time to compile a list of all files included in the CC license). Some of the artwork is converted from published sources, and you will find citations to those sources in the notes where the artwork is used. 

Files in the <tt>book</tt> subdirectory are either direct copies of those in the base directory or simple conversions to allow me to produce a single volume of notes: http://figshare.com/articles/Lecture_notes_in_population_genetics/100687. If you use or refer to these notes, please use the DOI from Figshare to cite them.

These notes will be revised from December, 2014 through April, 2015 while I am teaching my course. The source here will not match the PDF at Figshare. I expect to update that PDF in May, 2015.
